## Reflection

January, 2022 I have started to work on NFT project at my company. I have decided to join a community and buy the NFT(Zipcy's SuperNormal) which my friend started, in order to study how NFT market works while I work on the project at my company. In order to buy that NFT, I had to get ETH first. After earning profit with the NFT I bought, I wanted to study deeper about cryptocurrency. That's how I jumped into cryptomarket. 

In Korea, there is a Digital-Asset Exchange Website called Upbit. I used Upbit to exchange cryptocurrencies. I wanted to make an application which can use Upbit's openAPI and play around with it. 

Project goals included using technologies learned in Big Data course that I took while I was attending MSU, and to increase my Python experience & skils. This project is still in work, in order to expand my skills in computer science field.

One of the main challenges I ran into was making this program Object Oriented. This lead me to spend a few days on a research spike into how to use class object practically, and how to uee modules in Python.

This project was very fun and I could learn many things from it. I have got familiar with using many kinds of modules, and play around with matplot. Also, I could learn how crypto market flows.
